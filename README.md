Hello! I'm Jayalakshmi, and in this report, I present an analysis of India's energy landscape based on comprehensive yearly data provided by Ember. This dataset encompasses electricity generation, emissions, and carbon intensity metrics from 2010 to 2023, offering insights into the country's energy sector dynamics and environmental impact.

Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Ember, providing detailed yearly records on:

Electricity Generation (in GWh) Power Sector Emissions (in ktCO2) Carbon Intensity (in gCO2/kWh) The dataset captures these metrics across various sectors and technologies, enabling a comprehensive examination of trends and correlations over time.

Methodology and Tools
For this analysis, Python programming language was utilized along with the Plotly library for interactive data visualization.
